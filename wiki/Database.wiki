= Introduction =

The database is used to store a directed graph, where each "node" (vertice) contains a list of key-value attributes, and the "links" (edges) define child-to-parent relationships

Please notice that the data stored in this database is a graph instead of a tree because any node can have many parents, not just one

= The source graph file =

The graph stored in the database is originally edited as a .yaml file.
This is a sample node:
