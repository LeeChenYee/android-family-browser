#summary Future features

These are the _features_ we might implement in the near future:

----

== Bilingual English/Spanish ==

  * [Screenshots]
    * add buttons to switch language, to the `TabStart` pane
    * current language (English/Spanish) must be persistent
    * use the string assets to load the group names at the `TabIndex` pane
      * the names "Parents", "Children", "Siblings" are currently hard-coded
    * use icons (instead of words) for the tab names
      * use footprints instead of the word "Index"
      * use a leaf instead of the word "Content"
      * use a power dot instead of the word "Start"

  * [Database]
    * the "attributes" table must include attribute labels in English and Spanish

----

== Menu: Save Home / Go Home ==

This application always start at the same node, which currently is `Sof√≠a Cristina Chaves Chen`.  We should add a `Menu` option to set the current node to be the new starting node ("home")
